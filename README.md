# üìê IntegerTwoException

The **IntegerTwoException** is a custom exception designed to prevent division errors when the second integer is larger than the first. This exception ensures that you receive a full decimal result instead of a potentially misleading rounded value. Avoiding such pitfalls is essential for accurate calculations!

## How It Works

1. **Input the First Value**: Start by entering the first integer.
2. **Input the Second Value**: Next, input the second integer.
3. **Check the Values**: The system checks if the second integer is greater than the first.
4. **Trigger Exception**: If the second integer is larger, an exception is thrown with a relevant message.
5. **Display Result**: If no exception occurs, the operation proceeds, and the result is displayed.

## Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how **IntegerTwoException** can be utilized in your code:

```java
try {
    int result = divide(firstValue, secondValue);
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (IntegerTwoException e) {
    System.err.println(e.getMessage());
}
```
