### IntegerTwoException

this is the custom exception which helps us to avoid dividing two integer in case the second integer is larger than the first integer in order to obtain the full value or the full
result with point because if you don't check this you will get the a rounded value which sometimes is not good

## How it works

- **Step1** : You enter the first value
- **Step2** : You enter the second value
- **Step3** : We check if the second number is greater than the first number
- **Step4** : We follow the exception with a message
- **Step5** : Else we show the message
